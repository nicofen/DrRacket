; To evaluate an if expression:
; - if the question expression is not a value evaluate it, and replace it with value
; - if the question is true replace entire if expression with true answer expression
; - if the question is false replace entire if expression with false answer expression
; - the question is a value other than true or false so produce an error

(if (< (image-width I2)     ; Evaluate the question expression... reduce all of its
       (image-height I2))   ; operands to values. We have a call to the primative
    (image-width I2)        ; image-width. Reduce all of its operands to values.
    (image-height I2))      ; First operand is constant, produce a value for it.

(if (< (image-width .)     ; If expression. Reduce the question. Reduce the operands
       (image-height I2))   ; to this less-than. Here's the first operand. That's
    (image-width I2)        ; image-width of a rectangle picture. We just end up
    (image-height I2))      ; reducing this expression here this time... becoming 20.

(if (< 20                   ; Now, we're reducing this other operand to the less-than.
       (image-height I2))   ; The I2 becomes an image.

(if (< 20                   ; Continue to reduce this other operand to the less-than.

; Summarizing: We had to evaluate the if expression. If wants to evaluate its question
; expression first. This was a call to a primitive, in which both operands were calls
; to primatives. There is a fair amount of evaluation work we have to do before we've
; evaluated the question expression. We still now have a call to a primitive.

(if (< 20 10)               ; Both operands are values. Now we actually call (< 20 10).
    (image-width I2)        ; 20 is not less-than 10... false.
    (image-height I2))
 
(if false                   ; Go to the remaining rules of the if. The question
    (image-width I2)        ; expression produced false; replace the entire if
    (image-height I2))      ; expression with the false answer.

(image-height I2)           ; Reduce operands to values. Produce value for the constant.

(image-height .)           ; Reduce image-width primitive call and its picture argument.
